# Siggi's Minimap Buttons

> *Ever felt like your minimap just doesn't have ENOUGH buttons?*
> *Yeah, me neither.*

Clutter it up with as many fake buttons as your heart desires. Your guildmates will love you for it. *(They won't.)*

## 🤔 Why Does This Exist?

Great question. I don't have a good answer.

Maybe you want to look important. Maybe you want people to think you have 47 addons installed. Maybe you just want to watch the world burn — one tiny circular button at a time.

**Siggi's Minimap Buttons** lets you spawn unlimited fake minimap buttons that do absolutely nothing. They look real. They feel real. They are not real. Just like your arena rating.

## ✨ Features

- **Spawn unlimited fake minimap buttons** — because minimalism is overrated
- **Drag them around the minimap** — arrange your chaos with precision
- **Custom names** — call them whatever you want. "Recount". "DBM". "GirlfriendFinder 3000". We don't judge.
- **20 random icons** — every button gets a random icon, or pick one yourself if you're a control freak
- **Right-click to delete** — for when the regret hits
- **Full options panel** — a beautiful scrollable list of all your mistakes
- **Persists across sessions** — your poor life choices are saved to disk

## 💬 Slash Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `/siggi` | Shows help (you'll need it) |
| `/siggi add [name]` | Spawns a new button. Congratulations. |
| `/siggi remove <id>` | Removes a button by ID. Goodbye, little friend. |
| `/siggi removeall` | Nuclear option. Removes everything. |
| `/siggi list` | Lists all your buttons in chat, in case you lost count |
| `/siggi rename <id> <name>` | Rename a button to something even worse |
| `/siggi icon <id> <path>` | Change a button's icon texture |
| `/siggi options` | Opens the options panel for civilized people |

You can also use `/sgl` if `/siggi` is too many characters for your weary fingers.

## 🖱️ Mouse Interactions

- **Hover** over a button to see its name (and question your decisions)
- **Left-drag** to reposition it around the minimap like interior decorating, but worse
- **Right-click** to delete it (the only productive thing this addon lets you do)

---

## ⚙️ Options Panel

Access it via `/siggi options` or through the game's addon settings menu.

From here you can:
- Type a custom name for your next masterpiece
- Pick a specific icon (or keep it random for maximum chaos)
- Hit **Create Button** and watch your minimap suffer
- Hit **Remove All** when you finally come to your senses (requires confirmation, because we care about your feelings)
- Browse a scrollable list of every button you've created, with **Rename** and **Delete** buttons for each

It's basically a management simulator for things that don't need managing.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this addon do anything useful?**
A: No.

**Q: Will this improve my DPS?**
A: Technically, no. Spiritually, also no.

**Q: My guild leader is asking why I have 30 minimap buttons.**
A: That's not a question, but tell them each one adds 1% crit.

**Q: Can I make a button that actually does something?**
A: That sounds like a different addon. We don't do "useful" here.

**Q: Is this addon compatible with [other addon]?**
A: Probably. Our buttons don't actually interact with anything. That's kind of the whole point.

**Q: How do I uninstall this?**
A: `/siggi removeall`, then delete the addon folder. Or just leave the buttons there forever. They won't mind.

## 🫡 Credits

Made with questionable judgment by **EypoRage** during his work time.

*No minimaps were harmed in the making of this addon. Several were mildly inconvenienced.*
